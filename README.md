# Amazon Vine Analysis

##  Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is a difference in the 5 star rating of reviews for paid (vine) vs non-piad (non-vine) reviews.

## Results
1. We can see based on calculations made from the gathered data that we have a total of 904,765 reviews (Fig.1). Of those reviews, 572,916 were 5-star (Fig.2). That gives an overall rate of 63.32% of reviews being 5-stars (Fig.3). 
2. Of the total 904,765 reviews, only 2287 of them were paid (vine) reviews (Fig. 4), while 902,476 reviews were non-paid (non-vine) reviews (Fig. 5). 
3. When looking at the counts for 5-star reivews only, we see that paid-reviews accounted for 1290 reviews (Fig. 6) and non-paid 5-star reviews counted 571,626 (fig. 7). 
4. Percentage breakdowns for paid vs non-paid show that for paid reviews, 56.4% of them were 5-stars (Fig. 8) and non-paid reviews had a 63.34% of being 5-stars (Fig.9).

## Review
Given the calculations above, there appears to be no bias present in the data.  We can see that non-paid reviews had a higher probability of being 5-star than paid reviews by nearly 7% and at a rate that was nearly the same as the overall percentage of 5-star reviews. There is a correlation worth examining between the rates of paid vs non-paid reviews and the how often they will be 5-stars and calculations for. Further calucations to determine statistical significance would be in order to ensure that the data is being used properly moving forward.
